I'm moving on from Zoho after 4 years of working with one of their biggest products (Servicedesk Plus). It was a great journey. I learnt a lot and I was able to have a considerable impact in the product itself.

The team at Zoho was great at filling gaps for each other, and was held tightly together by good internal competitiion and know-how to build complicated products.

I will be joining Syncron soon.
