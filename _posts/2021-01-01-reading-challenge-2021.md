## An update on my reading challenge for this year

Time has been short lately as I have picked up multiple projects for completion. Keeping that in mind, I'm targeting just 20 books this year. Starting the year by reading **Ghachar Ghochar by Vivek Shanbhag (translated to English)**

I will be reviewing books as and when I complete them.
