## One line review - Animal Farm

An amazing book by all standards. Orwell obviously does an amazing job in laying out tough to understand principles in a straight forward manner.

Next up, I will be reading **Pyre by Perumal Murugan** again. I keep going back to this small book from time to time and I think it is time to read it again.
