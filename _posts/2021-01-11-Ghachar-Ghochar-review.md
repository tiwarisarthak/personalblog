## One line review - Ghachar Ghochar

What a great read! A prime example of the literature hidden in other languages. The book covers multiple aspects of Indian life and growing up in a world and adjusting to changes around you.

Next up, I will be reading **Animal Farm by George Orwell** again. I keep going back to this small book from time to time and I think it is time to read it again.
