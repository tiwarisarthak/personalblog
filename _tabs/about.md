### Hello 👋🏽

I'm a software engineer based out of Bangalore. Currently, I'm working at Amazon where I build and maintain orchestration solutions that make it easy for devlopers to iterate and build faster without depending on other teams.

I specialize in making distributed architecture that can handle scale.

I have a coding background of 16 years (started when I was 10), out of which ten years are in products used by actual clients and five with industry leading products.

I have worked in multiple roles across multiple teams and I like to wear different hats as and when the situation demands.

If you want to talk, you can drop me an email at <sarthaktiwari306@gmail.com>.
